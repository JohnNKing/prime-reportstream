# About ReportStream

## Introduction
The PRIME ReportStream project is the part of the Pandemic Ready Interoperable Modernization Effort that works with 
state and local public health departments. The project is a joint effort between the CDC and USDS. Currently, we are 
focusing on the problem of delivering COVID-19 test data to public health departments. Later, we will work on other 
tools to analyze and explore this data and different types of health data. See the 
[PRIME ReportStream website](https://reportstream.cdc.gov) for further details.

PRIME ReportStream a sibling project to [PRIME SimpleReport](https://simplereport.gov) which is better way to report 
COVID-19 rapid tests.

PRIME ReportStream is a member of the [Open CDC](https://open.cdc.gov/) community.

## The Past
The PRIME project was born in and of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. As the pandemic spread, testing became critically
important to public health departments around the country. Without testing, it is impossible to tell where the disease
is, and where it is moving to. As the need for testing grew, many companies and organizations stepped up and filled the
gap, but that presented a new problem: in traditional public health reporting, the rate of reporting is low enough that
it is easily manageable, but that was quickly not the case with COVID. Many locations that were conducting the testing
did not have an easy way to report the results they collected, and many public health departments did not have systems
available to collect the data from many different locations, 
[so they fell back to faxing results in](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/13/upshot/coronavirus-response-fax-machines.html). 
While faxing is ubiquitous and secure, it is not designed for high volumes. 

In order to address this problem the CDC proposed building a system that would allow local testing facilities the
ability to quickly record test results, and seamlessly send them on to the state public health agencies. The work of
recording the test results was accomplished by the SimpleReport team, and the job of connecting and sending the data to 
public health agencies is done by ReportStream.
